IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent <span class='hlg'>&amp;&amp; ping -n 6 localhost</span> as payload to the application. This payload has a small system command - <span class='hlg'>ping -n 6 localhost</span>. If this command is executed then the server will ping itself <span class='hlg'>6</span> times. This will cause the response to be returned around <span class='hlg'>5000</span> milliseconds later than usual. After the payload was injected the response from the application took <span class='hlg'>5089</span> milliseconds.

<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
To check if this was a valid case or a false positive you can manually inject the same payload but by changing the number of ping requests sent to different values.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent <span class='hlg'>&amp;&amp; ping -n 6 localhost</span> as payload to the application. This payload has a small system command - <span class='hlg'>ping -n 6 localhost</span>. If this command is executed then the server will ping itself <span class='hlg'>6</span> times. This will cause the response to be returned around <span class='hlg'>5000</span> milliseconds later than usual. After the payload was injected the response from the application took <span class='hlg'>5098</span> milliseconds. Normally this particular request is processed at around <span class='hlg'>21</span> milliseconds. This indicates that the injected command could have been executed on the server-side.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
To check if this was a valid case or a false positive you can manually inject the same payload but by changing the number of ping requests sent to different values.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent <span class='hlg'>&amp;&amp; ping -n 6 localhost</span> as payload to the application. This payload has a small system command - <span class='hlg'>ping -n 6 localhost</span>. If this command is executed then the server will ping itself <span class='hlg'>6</span> times. This will cause the response to be returned around <span class='hlg'>5000</span> milliseconds later than usual. After the payload was injected the response from the application took <span class='hlg'>5097</span> milliseconds. Normally this particular request is processed at around <span class='hlg'>20</span> milliseconds. This indicates that the injected command could have been executed on the server-side.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
To check if this was a valid case or a false positive you can manually inject the same payload but by changing the number of ping requests sent to different values.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent <span class='hlg'>&amp;&amp; ping -n 6 localhost</span> as payload to the application. This payload has a small system command - <span class='hlg'>ping -n 6 localhost</span>. If this command is executed then the server will ping itself <span class='hlg'>6</span> times. This will cause the response to be returned around <span class='hlg'>5000</span> milliseconds later than usual. After the payload was injected the response from the application took <span class='hlg'>5108</span> milliseconds. Normally this particular request is processed at around <span class='hlg'>30</span> milliseconds. This indicates that the injected command could have been executed on the server-side.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
To check if this was a valid case or a false positive you can manually inject the same payload but by changing the number of ping requests sent to different values.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent <span class='hlg'>&amp;&amp; ping -n 6 localhost</span> as payload to the application. This payload has a small system command - <span class='hlg'>ping -n 6 localhost</span>. If this command is executed then the server will ping itself <span class='hlg'>6</span> times. This will cause the response to be returned around <span class='hlg'>5000</span> milliseconds later than usual. After the payload was injected the response from the application took <span class='hlg'>5094</span> milliseconds. Normally this particular request is processed at around <span class='hlg'>28</span> milliseconds. This indicates that the injected command could have been executed on the server-side.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
To check if this was a valid case or a false positive you can manually inject the same payload but by changing the number of ping requests sent to different values.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent <span class='hlg'>&amp;&amp; ping -n 6 localhost</span> as payload to the application. This payload has a small system command - <span class='hlg'>ping -n 6 localhost</span>. If this command is executed then the server will ping itself <span class='hlg'>6</span> times. This will cause the response to be returned around <span class='hlg'>5000</span> milliseconds later than usual. After the payload was injected the response from the application took <span class='hlg'>5100</span> milliseconds. Normally this particular request is processed at around <span class='hlg'>23</span> milliseconds. This indicates that the injected command could have been executed on the server-side.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
To check if this was a valid case or a false positive you can manually inject the same payload but by changing the number of ping requests sent to different values.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>bar' and 8=8--</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>bar' and 7=5--</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>bar' and 7=7--</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>bar' and 5=8--</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>AND</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with values in the boolean expression and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 8=8--</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=5--</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=7--</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 5=8--</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with values in the boolean expression and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 8=8--</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=5--</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=7--</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 5=8--</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with values in the boolean expression and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 8=8--</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=5--</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=7--</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 5=8--</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with values in the boolean expression and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 8=8--</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=5--</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=7--</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 5=8--</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with values in the boolean expression and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

IronWASP sent six payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>2+1</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>1+2</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>3+5</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>2+6</span><br>Payload E - <span class='hlg'>3+a</span><br>Payload F - <span class='hlg'>3+b</span><br>Payload A and B is the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>3</span>. Payload C and D is also the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>8</span>. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts as a number is being added to a string.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the addition of the two numbers in the Payload A and B. Since they add up to the same value their responses are similar. Payloads C and D add up to different values. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts. If the application was not actually performing addition then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the six payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with different numbers and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>bar' and 's'='s</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>bar' and 's'='r</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>bar' and 't'='t</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>bar' and 't'='r</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>AND</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with values in the boolean expression and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reason:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason:</div>
IronWASP sent six payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>2+1</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>1+2</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>3+5</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>2+6</span><br>Payload E - <span class='hlg'>3+a</span><br>Payload F - <span class='hlg'>3+b</span><br>Payload A and B is the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>3</span>. Payload C and D is also the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>8</span>. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts as a number is being added to a string.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the addition of the two numbers in the Payload A and B. Since they add up to the same value their responses are similar. Payloads C and D add up to different values. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts. If the application was not actually performing addition then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the six payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with different numbers and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='desc'><div class='desc_title'>Description:</div>SQL Injection was identified in the <span class='ico'><b>BenchmarkTest00849</b></span> parameter of the <span class='ico'><b>Query</b></span> section of the scanned request.<br><br>SQL Injection is an issue where it is possible execute SQL queries on the database being used on the server-side. For more details on this issue refer <span class='icb'>https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection</span><br><br></div>
<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 8=8--</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=5--</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=7--</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 5=8--</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with values in the boolean expression and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='desc'><div class='desc_title'>Description:</div>SQL Injection was identified in the <span class='ico'><b>BenchmarkTest00850</b></span> parameter of the <span class='ico'><b>Query</b></span> section of the scanned request.<br><br>SQL Injection is an issue where it is possible execute SQL queries on the database being used on the server-side. For more details on this issue refer <span class='icb'>https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection</span><br><br></div>
<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 8=8--</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=5--</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=7--</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 5=8--</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with values in the boolean expression and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reason:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason:</div>
IronWASP sent three payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>b&quot;||&quot;ar</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>b&quot;+&quot;ar</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>b&quot; &quot;ar</span><br>Payload A is trying to concatenate two strings as per the SQL syntax of Oracle database servers. Payload B is trying to concatenate the same two strings as per SQL syntax of MS SQL database servers. Payload C is trying to concatenate the same two strings as per the SQL syntax of MySQL database servers.<br>The response for Payload A and B were similar to each other and is different from the response received for Payloads C. This indicates that the application was actually trying to perform the string concatenation on the server-side and that the backend database in use is <span class='hlg'>MySQL</span>. Since incase of <span class='hlg'>MySQL</span> database server Payloads A &amp; B would have simply thrown an invalid SQL syntax exception their responses are similar. And Payload C would have executed without this error and so its response was different than the other two.<br>If the application was not actually performing the concatenation then all three payload should have received very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the three payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with different strings and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>bar' and 8=8--</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>bar' and 7=5--</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>bar' and 7=7--</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>bar' and 5=8--</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>AND</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reason:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason:</div>
IronWASP sent six payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>2+1</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>1+2</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>3+5</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>2+6</span><br>Payload E - <span class='hlg'>3+a</span><br>Payload F - <span class='hlg'>3+b</span><br>Payload A and B is the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>3</span>. Payload C and D is also the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>8</span>. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts as a number is being added to a string.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the addition of the two numbers in the Payload A and B. Since they add up to the same value their responses are similar. Payloads C and D add up to different values. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts. If the application was not actually performing addition then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the six payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with different numbers and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent three payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>b'||'ar</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>b'+'ar</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>b' 'ar</span><br>Payload A is trying to concatenate two strings as per the SQL syntax of Oracle database servers. Payload B is trying to concatenate the same two strings as per SQL syntax of MS SQL database servers. Payload C is trying to concatenate the same two strings as per the SQL syntax of MySQL database servers.<br>The response for Payload A and B were similar to each other and is different from the response received for Payloads C. This indicates that the application was actually trying to perform the string concatenation on the server-side and that the backend database in use is <span class='hlg'>MySQL</span>. Since incase of <span class='hlg'>MySQL</span> database server Payloads A &amp; B would have simply thrown an invalid SQL syntax exception their responses are similar. And Payload C would have executed without this error and so its response was different than the other two.<br>If the application was not actually performing the concatenation then all three payload should have received very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the three payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them.

IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>bar' and 's'='s</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>bar' and 's'='r</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>bar' and 't'='t</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>bar' and 't'='r</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>AND</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with values in the boolean expression and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 8=8--</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=5--</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=7--</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 5=8--</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with values in the boolean expression and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reason:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason:</div>
IronWASP sent six payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>2+1</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>1+2</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>3+5</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>2+6</span><br>Payload E - <span class='hlg'>3+a</span><br>Payload F - <span class='hlg'>3+b</span><br>Payload A and B is the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>3</span>. Payload C and D is also the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>8</span>. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts as a number is being added to a string.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the addition of the two numbers in the Payload A and B. Since they add up to the same value their responses are similar. Payloads C and D add up to different values. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts. If the application was not actually performing addition then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the six payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with different numbers and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reason:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason:</div>
IronWASP sent three payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>A&quot;||&quot;EAC4CAB96B6902A1B50A51ABD5C6796</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>A&quot;+&quot;EAC4CAB96B6902A1B50A51ABD5C6796</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>A&quot; &quot;EAC4CAB96B6902A1B50A51ABD5C6796</span><br>Payload A is trying to concatenate two strings as per the SQL syntax of Oracle database servers. Payload B is trying to concatenate the same two strings as per SQL syntax of MS SQL database servers. Payload C is trying to concatenate the same two strings as per the SQL syntax of MySQL database servers.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and is different from the response received for Payloads B. This indicates that the application was actually trying to perform the string concatenation on the server-side and that the backend database in use is <span class='hlg'>MS SQL</span>. Since incase of <span class='hlg'>MS SQL</span> database server Payloads A &amp; C would have simply thrown an invalid SQL syntax exception their responses are similar. And Payload B would have executed without this error and so its response was different than the other two.<br>If the application was not actually performing the concatenation then all three payload should have received very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the three payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with different strings and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reason:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason:</div>
IronWASP sent six payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>2+1</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>1+2</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>3+5</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>2+6</span><br>Payload E - <span class='hlg'>3+a</span><br>Payload F - <span class='hlg'>3+b</span><br>Payload A and B is the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>3</span>. Payload C and D is also the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>8</span>. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts as a number is being added to a string.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the addition of the two numbers in the Payload A and B. Since they add up to the same value their responses are similar. Payloads C and D add up to different values. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts. If the application was not actually performing addition then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the six payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with different numbers and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 8=8--</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=5--</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=7--</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 5=8--</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with values in the boolean expression and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reason:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason:</div>
IronWASP sent six payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>2+1</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>1+2</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>3+5</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>2+6</span><br>Payload E - <span class='hlg'>3+a</span><br>Payload F - <span class='hlg'>3+b</span><br>Payload A and B is the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>3</span>. Payload C and D is also the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>8</span>. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts as a number is being added to a string.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the addition of the two numbers in the Payload A and B. Since they add up to the same value their responses are similar. Payloads C and D add up to different values. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts. If the application was not actually performing addition then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the six payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with different numbers and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent three payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>b'||'ar</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>b'+'ar</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>b' 'ar</span><br>Payload A is trying to concatenate two strings as per the SQL syntax of Oracle database servers. Payload B is trying to concatenate the same two strings as per SQL syntax of MS SQL database servers. Payload C is trying to concatenate the same two strings as per the SQL syntax of MySQL database servers.<br>The response for Payload B and C were similar to each other and is different from the response received for Payloads A. This indicates that the application was actually trying to perform the string concatenation on the server-side and that the backend database in use is <span class='hlg'>Oracle</span>. Since incase of <span class='hlg'>Oracle</span> database server Payloads B &amp; C would have simply thrown an invalid SQL syntax exception their responses are similar. And Payload A would have executed without this error and so its response was different than the other two.<br>If the application was not actually performing the concatenation then all three payload should have received very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the three payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with different strings and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reason:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason:</div>
IronWASP sent six payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>2+1</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>1+2</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>3+5</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>2+6</span><br>Payload E - <span class='hlg'>3+a</span><br>Payload F - <span class='hlg'>3+b</span><br>Payload A and B is the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>3</span>. Payload C and D is also the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>8</span>. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts as a number is being added to a string.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the addition of the two numbers in the Payload A and B. Since they add up to the same value their responses are similar. Payloads C and D add up to different values. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts. If the application was not actually performing addition then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the six payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with different numbers and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reason:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason:</div>
IronWASP sent three payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>M'||'ovies</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>M'+'ovies</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>M' 'ovies</span><br>Payload A is trying to concatenate two strings as per the SQL syntax of Oracle database servers.

Payload C is trying to concatenate the same two strings as per the SQL syntax of MySQL database servers.<br>The response for Payload A and B were similar to each other and is different from the response received for Payloads C. This indicates that the application was actually trying to perform the string concatenation on the server-side and that the backend database in use is <span class='hlg'>MySQL</span>. Since incase of <span class='hlg'>MySQL</span> database server Payloads A &amp; B would have simply thrown an invalid SQL syntax exception their responses are similar.

Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 8=8--</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=5--</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=7--</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 5=8--</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with values in the boolean expression and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reason:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason:</div>
IronWASP sent six payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>2+1</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>1+2</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>3+5</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>2+6</span><br>Payload E - <span class='hlg'>3+a</span><br>Payload F - <span class='hlg'>3+b</span><br>Payload A and B is the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>3</span>. Payload C and D is also the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>8</span>. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts as a number is being added to a string.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the addition of the two numbers in the Payload A and B. Since they add up to the same value their responses are similar. Payloads C and D add up to different values. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts. If the application was not actually performing addition then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the six payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with different numbers and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reason:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason:</div>
IronWASP sent six payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>2+1</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>1+2</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>3+5</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>2+6</span><br>Payload E - <span class='hlg'>3+a</span><br>Payload F - <span class='hlg'>3+b</span><br>Payload A and B is the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>3</span>. Payload C and D is also the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>8</span>. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts as a number is being added to a string.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the addition of the two numbers in the Payload A and B. Since they add up to the same value their responses are similar. Payloads C and D add up to different values. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts. If the application was not actually performing addition then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the six payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with different numbers and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>. Your feedback will help improve the accuracy of the scanner.

IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reason:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason:</div>
IronWASP sent six payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>2+1</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>1+2</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>3+5</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>2+6</span><br>Payload E - <span class='hlg'>3+a</span><br>Payload F - <span class='hlg'>3+b</span><br>Payload A and B is the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>3</span>. Payload C and D is also the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>8</span>. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts as a number is being added to a string.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the addition of the two numbers in the Payload A and B. Since they add up to the same value their responses are similar. Payloads C and D add up to different values. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts. If the application was not actually performing addition then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the six payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 8=8--</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=5--</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=7--</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 5=8--</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with values in the boolean expression and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 8=8--</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=5--</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=7--</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 5=8--</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with values in the boolean expression and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 8=8--</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=5--</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=7--</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 5=8--</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reason:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason:</div>
IronWASP sent three payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>M&quot;||&quot;ozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.2; Trident/6.0)</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>M&quot;+&quot;ozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.2; Trident/6.0)</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>M&quot; &quot;ozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.2; Trident/6.0)</span><br>Payload A is trying to concatenate two strings as per the SQL syntax of Oracle database servers. Payload B is trying to concatenate the same two strings as per SQL syntax of MS SQL database servers. Payload C is trying to concatenate the same two strings as per the SQL syntax of MySQL database servers.<br>The response for Payload B and C were similar to each other and is different from the response received for Payloads A. This indicates that the application was actually trying to perform the string concatenation on the server-side and that the backend database in use is <span class='hlg'>Oracle</span>. Since incase of <span class='hlg'>Oracle</span> database server Payloads B &amp; C would have simply thrown an invalid SQL syntax exception their responses are similar. And Payload A would have executed without this error and so its response was different than the other two.<br>If the application was not actually performing the concatenation then all three payload should have received very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the three payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 8=8--</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=5--</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=7--</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 5=8--</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with values in the boolean expression and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 8=8--</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=5--</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=7--</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 5=8--</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with values in the boolean expression and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 8=8--</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=5--</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=7--</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 5=8--</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with values in the boolean expression and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 8=8--</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=5--</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=7--</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 5=8--</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with values in the boolean expression and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reason:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason:</div>
IronWASP sent six payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>2+1</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>1+2</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>3+5</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>2+6</span><br>Payload E - <span class='hlg'>3+a</span><br>Payload F - <span class='hlg'>3+b</span><br>Payload A and B is the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>3</span>. Payload C and D is also the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>8</span>. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts as a number is being added to a string.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the addition of the two numbers in the Payload A and B. Since they add up to the same value their responses are similar. Payloads C and D add up to different values. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts. If the application was not actually performing addition then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the six payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with different numbers and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reason:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason:</div>
IronWASP sent six payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>2+1</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>1+2</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>3+5</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>2+6</span><br>Payload E - <span class='hlg'>3+a</span><br>Payload F - <span class='hlg'>3+b</span><br>Payload A and B is the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>3</span>. Payload C and D is also the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>8</span>. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts as a number is being added to a string.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the addition of the two numbers in the Payload A and B. Since they add up to the same value their responses are similar. Payloads C and D add up to different values. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts. If the application was not actually performing addition then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the six payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them.

IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reason:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason:</div>
IronWASP sent six payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>2+1</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>1+2</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>3+5</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>2+6</span><br>Payload E - <span class='hlg'>3+a</span><br>Payload F - <span class='hlg'>3+b</span><br>Payload A and B is the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>3</span>. Payload C and D is also the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>8</span>. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts as a number is being added to a string.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the addition of the two numbers in the Payload A and B. Since they add up to the same value their responses are similar. Payloads C and D add up to different values. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts. If the application was not actually performing addition then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the six payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with different numbers and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reason:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason:</div>
IronWASP sent three payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>b'||'ar</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>b'+'ar</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>b' 'ar</span><br>Payload A is trying to concatenate two strings as per the SQL syntax of Oracle database servers. Payload B is trying to concatenate the same two strings as per SQL syntax of MS SQL database servers. Payload C is trying to concatenate the same two strings as per the SQL syntax of MySQL database servers.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and is different from the response received for Payloads B. This indicates that the application was actually trying to perform the string concatenation on the server-side and that the backend database in use is <span class='hlg'>MS SQL</span>. Since incase of <span class='hlg'>MS SQL</span> database server Payloads A &amp; C would have simply thrown an invalid SQL syntax exception their responses are similar. And Payload B would have executed without this error and so its response was different than the other two.<br>If the application was not actually performing the concatenation then all three payload should have received very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the three payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them.

So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 8=8--</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=5--</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=7--</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 5=8--</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with values in the boolean expression and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reason:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason:</div>
IronWASP sent three payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>a&quot;||&quot;pplication/x-www-form-urlencoded</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>a&quot;+&quot;pplication/x-www-form-urlencoded</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>a&quot; &quot;pplication/x-www-form-urlencoded</span><br>Payload A is trying to concatenate two strings as per the SQL syntax of Oracle database servers. Payload B is trying to concatenate the same two strings as per SQL syntax of MS SQL database servers. Payload C is trying to concatenate the same two strings as per the SQL syntax of MySQL database servers.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and is different from the response received for Payloads B. This indicates that the application was actually trying to perform the string concatenation on the server-side and that the backend database in use is <span class='hlg'>MS SQL</span>. Since incase of <span class='hlg'>MS SQL</span> database server Payloads A &amp; C would have simply thrown an invalid SQL syntax exception their responses are similar. And Payload B would have executed without this error and so its response was different than the other two.<br>If the application was not actually performing the concatenation then all three payload should have received very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the three payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with different strings and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 8=8--</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=5--</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=7--</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 5=8--</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with values in the boolean expression and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reason:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason:</div>
IronWASP sent three payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>1'||'A07AA987B519672B9A12AC39C315745</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>1'+'A07AA987B519672B9A12AC39C315745</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>1' 'A07AA987B519672B9A12AC39C315745</span><br>Payload A is trying to concatenate two strings as per the SQL syntax of Oracle database servers. Payload B is trying to concatenate the same two strings as per SQL syntax of MS SQL database servers. Payload C is trying to concatenate the same two strings as per the SQL syntax of MySQL database servers.<br>The response for Payload A and B were similar to each other and is different from the response received for Payloads C. This indicates that the application was actually trying to perform the string concatenation on the server-side and that the backend database in use is <span class='hlg'>MySQL</span>. Since incase of <span class='hlg'>MySQL</span> database server Payloads A &amp; B would have simply thrown an invalid SQL syntax exception their responses are similar. And Payload C would have executed without this error and so its response was different than the other two.<br>If the application was not actually performing the concatenation then all three payload should have received very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the three payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with different strings and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reason:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason:</div>
IronWASP sent six payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>2+1</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>1+2</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>3+5</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>2+6</span><br>Payload E - <span class='hlg'>3+a</span><br>Payload F - <span class='hlg'>3+b</span><br>Payload A and B is the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>3</span>. Payload C and D is also the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>8</span>. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts as a number is being added to a string.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the addition of the two numbers in the Payload A and B. Since they add up to the same value their responses are similar. Payloads C and D add up to different values. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts. If the application was not actually performing addition then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the six payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reason:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason:</div>
IronWASP sent six payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>2+1</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>1+2</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>3+5</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>2+6</span><br>Payload E - <span class='hlg'>3+a</span><br>Payload F - <span class='hlg'>3+b</span><br>Payload A and B is the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>3</span>. Payload C and D is also the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>8</span>. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts as a number is being added to a string.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the addition of the two numbers in the Payload A and B. Since they add up to the same value their responses are similar. Payloads C and D add up to different values. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts. If the application was not actually performing addition then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the six payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with different numbers and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reason:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason:</div>
IronWASP sent six payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>2+1</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>1+2</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>3+5</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>2+6</span><br>Payload E - <span class='hlg'>3+a</span><br>Payload F - <span class='hlg'>3+b</span><br>Payload A and B is the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>3</span>. Payload C and D is also the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>8</span>. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts as a number is being added to a string.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the addition of the two numbers in the Payload A and B. Since they add up to the same value their responses are similar. Payloads C and D add up to different values. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts. If the application was not actually performing addition then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the six payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with different numbers and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reason:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason:</div>
IronWASP sent six payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>2+1</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>1+2</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>3+5</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>2+6</span><br>Payload E - <span class='hlg'>3+a</span><br>Payload F - <span class='hlg'>3+b</span><br>Payload A and B is the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>3</span>. Payload C and D is also the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>8</span>. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts as a number is being added to a string.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the addition of the two numbers in the Payload A and B. Since they add up to the same value their responses are similar. Payloads C and D add up to different values. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts. If the application was not actually performing addition then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the six payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reason:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason:</div>
IronWASP sent six payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>2+1</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>1+2</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>3+5</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>2+6</span><br>Payload E - <span class='hlg'>3+a</span><br>Payload F - <span class='hlg'>3+b</span><br>Payload A and B is the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>3</span>. Payload C and D is also the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>8</span>. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts as a number is being added to a string.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the addition of the two numbers in the Payload A and B. Since they add up to the same value their responses are similar. Payloads C and D add up to different values. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts. If the application was not actually performing addition then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the six payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with different numbers and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reason:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason:</div>
IronWASP sent six payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>2+1</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>1+2</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>3+5</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>2+6</span><br>Payload E - <span class='hlg'>3+a</span><br>Payload F - <span class='hlg'>3+b</span><br>Payload A and B is the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>3</span>. Payload C and D is also the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>8</span>. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts as a number is being added to a string.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the addition of the two numbers in the Payload A and B. Since they add up to the same value their responses are similar. Payloads C and D add up to different values. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts. If the application was not actually performing addition then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the six payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with different numbers and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='desc'><div class='desc_title'>Description:</div>SQL Injection was identified in the <span class='ico'><b>BenchmarkTest02269</b></span> parameter of the <span class='ico'><b>Body</b></span> section of the scanned request.<br><br>SQL Injection is an issue where it is possible execute SQL queries on the database being used on the server-side. For more details on this issue refer <span class='icb'>https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection</span><br><br></div>
<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 8=8--</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=5--</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=7--</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 5=8--</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with values in the boolean expression and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='desc'><div class='desc_title'>Description:</div>SQL Injection was identified in the <span class='ico'><b>BenchmarkTest02270</b></span> parameter of the <span class='ico'><b>Body</b></span> section of the scanned request.<br><br>SQL Injection is an issue where it is possible execute SQL queries on the database being used on the server-side. For more details on this issue refer <span class='icb'>https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection</span><br><br></div>
<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 8=8--</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=5--</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=7--</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 5=8--</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with values in the boolean expression and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>bar' and 8=8--</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>bar' and 7=5--</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>bar' and 7=7--</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>bar' and 5=8--</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>AND</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with values in the boolean expression and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts as a number is being added to a string.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F.

If the application was not actually performing addition then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.

The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D.

Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts as a number is being added to a string.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the addition of the two numbers in the Payload A and B. Since they add up to the same value their responses are similar. Payloads C and D add up to different values. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts. If the application was not actually performing addition then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the six payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them.

<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 4:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>bar' and 's'='s</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>bar' and 's'='r</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>bar' and 't'='t</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>bar' and 't'='r</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>AND</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with values in the boolean expression and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 8=8--</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=5--</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=7--</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 5=8--</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with values in the boolean expression and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 8=8--</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=5--</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=7--</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 5=8--</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with values in the boolean expression and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 8=8--</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=5--</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=7--</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 5=8--</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with values in the boolean expression and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 8=8--</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=5--</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=7--</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 5=8--</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reason:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason:</div>
IronWASP sent six payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>2+1</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>1+2</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>3+5</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>2+6</span><br>Payload E - <span class='hlg'>3+a</span><br>Payload F - <span class='hlg'>3+b</span><br>Payload A and B is the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>3</span>. Payload C and D is also the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>8</span>. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts as a number is being added to a string.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the addition of the two numbers in the Payload A and B. Since they add up to the same value their responses are similar. Payloads C and D add up to different values. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts. If the application was not actually performing addition then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the six payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with different numbers and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reason:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason:</div>
IronWASP sent three payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>f&quot;||&quot;oo</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>f&quot;+&quot;oo</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>f&quot; &quot;oo</span><br>Payload A is trying to concatenate two strings as per the SQL syntax of Oracle database servers.

Payload C is trying to concatenate the same two strings as per the SQL syntax of MySQL database servers.<br>The response for Payload A and B were similar to each other and is different from the response received for Payloads C. This indicates that the application was actually trying to perform the string concatenation on the server-side and that the backend database in use is <span class='hlg'>MySQL</span>. Since incase of <span class='hlg'>MySQL</span> database server Payloads A &amp; B would have simply thrown an invalid SQL syntax exception their responses are similar.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 8=8--</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=5--</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 7=7--</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 5=8--</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with values in the boolean expression and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reason:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason:</div>
IronWASP sent six payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>2+1</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>1+2</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>3+5</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>2+6</span><br>Payload E - <span class='hlg'>3+a</span><br>Payload F - <span class='hlg'>3+b</span><br>Payload A and B is the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>3</span>. Payload C and D is also the addition of two numbers whose sum would be <span class='hlg'>8</span>. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts as a number is being added to a string.<br>The response for Payload A and B is similar to each other and is different from Payloads C, D, E and F. This indicates that the application actually performed the addition of the two numbers in the Payload A and B. Since they add up to the same value their responses are similar. Payloads C and D add up to different values. Payload E and F are invalid addition attempts. If the application was not actually performing addition then all six payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reasons:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason 1:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 's'='s</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 's'='r</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 't'='t</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>barxxx' or 't'='r</span><br>Payload A and C have a boolean condition after the <span class='hlg'>OR</span> keyword that will evaluate to true. The boolean condition in Payload B and D would evaluate to false.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and were different from the response received for Payload B and D. This indicates that the application was actually evaluating the boolean condition in the payloads. So since Payload A and C both has a true boolean condition their responses are similar, C and D had a false boolean condition.<br>If the application was not actually evaluating the boolean condition then all four payload should have returned very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the four payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with values in the boolean expression and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

IronWASP sent three payloads to the application with SQL code snippets in them.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>1'||'A07AA987B519672B9A12AC39C315745</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>1'+'A07AA987B519672B9A12AC39C315745</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>1' 'A07AA987B519672B9A12AC39C315745</span><br>Payload A is trying to concatenate two strings as per the SQL syntax of Oracle database servers. Payload B is trying to concatenate the same two strings as per SQL syntax of MS SQL database servers. Payload C is trying to concatenate the same two strings as per the SQL syntax of MySQL database servers.<br>The response for Payload A and C were similar to each other and is different from the response received for Payloads B. This indicates that the application was actually trying to perform the string concatenation on the server-side and that the backend database in use is <span class='hlg'>MS SQL</span>. Since incase of <span class='hlg'>MS SQL</span> database server Payloads A &amp; C would have simply thrown an invalid SQL syntax exception their responses are similar. And Payload B would have executed without this error and so its response was different than the other two.<br>If the application was not actually performing the concatenation then all three payload should have received very similar responses. Therefore this indicates that SQL syntax from the payload is executed as part of the SQL query on the server.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
Manually analyze the responses received for the three payloads and confirm if the type of similarity explained above actually exists in them. Try resending the same payloads again but with different strings and check if this behaviour is repeated.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reason:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>aa\..\nnnn</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>aa..\nnnn</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>bb\..\nnnn</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>bb..\nnnn</span><br><br>Payloads A and C are similar in nature. They both refer to the file <span class='hlg'>nnnn</span> by including an imaginary directory in the path (aa &amp; bb) but then also invalidating it by traversing upwards by one directory using <span class='hlg'>..\</span>. So these payloads must have the same effect as referring to the file <span class='hlg'>nnnn</span> normally.<br>Payloads B and D are similar to each other but different from A &amp; C. They refer to the file <span class='hlg'>nnnn</span> inside invalid directories (aa &amp; bb).<br>If the application is vulnerable to Local File Include then the response for Payloads A &amp; C must be similar to each other and different from responses for Payloads B&amp;D. The responses for the injected payloads were analyzed and it was found that Payloads A &amp; C got a similar looking response and were also different from responses got from Payloads B &amp; D, thereby indicating the presence of this vulnerability.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
To check if this was a valid case or a false positive you can first manually look at the responses received for Payloads A, B, C and D. Analyze these payloads and verify if indeed A &amp; C got similar responses and were different from B &amp; D. You can also change the payloads for A &amp; C by adding one more invalid directory and one more <span class='hlg'>..\</span> to invalidate that directory. This must get the same response as the responses for A &amp; C.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

<div class='reason_section_title'>Reasons:</div>
IronWASP has reported this issue because of the following reason:<br>
<div class='reason'><div class='reason_title'>Reason:</div>
IronWASP sent four payloads to the application.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>aa/../application/x-www-form-urlencoded</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>aa../application/x-www-form-urlencoded</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>bb/../application/x-www-form-urlencoded</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>bb../application/x-www-form-urlencoded</span><br><br>Payloads A and C are similar in nature. They both refer to the file <span class='hlg'>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</span> by including an imaginary directory in the path (aa &amp; bb) but then also invalidating it by traversing upwards by one directory using <span class='hlg'>../</span>. So these payloads must have the same effect as referring to the file <span class='hlg'>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</span> normally.<br>Payloads B and D are similar to each other but different from A &amp; C. They refer to the file <span class='hlg'>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</span> inside invalid directories (aa &amp; bb).<br>If the application is vulnerable to Local File Include then the response for Payloads A &amp; C must be similar to each other and different from responses for Payloads B&amp;D. The responses for the injected payloads were analyzed and it was found that Payloads A &amp; C got a similar looking response and were also different from responses got from Payloads B &amp; D, thereby indicating the presence of this vulnerability.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
To check if this was a valid case or a false positive you can first manually look at the responses received for Payloads A, B, C and D. Analyze these payloads and verify if indeed A &amp; C got similar responses and were different from B &amp; D. You can also change the payloads for A &amp; C by adding one more invalid directory and one more <span class='hlg'>../</span> to invalidate that directory. This must get the same response as the responses for A &amp; C.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.

IronWASP sent four payloads to the application.<br>Payload A - <span class='hlg'>localhost:65555</span><br>Payload B - <span class='hlg'>localhost:65533</span><br>Payload C - <span class='hlg'>localhost:66666</span><br>Payload D - <span class='hlg'>localhost:65534</span><br><br>Payloads A and C are similar in nature.

They both refer to ports 65533 and 65534 on the server which are valid ports.<br>If the application is vulnerable to SSRF then it will try to connect to these ports and connections to invalid ports with throw an exception of different type than the exception or error caused by connecting to the valid ports 65533 and 65534 which are most likely to be closed.<br>This would mean that the response for Payloads A &amp; C must be similar to each other and different from responses for Payloads B&amp;D. <br><br>The responses for the injected payloads were analyzed and it was found that Payloads A &amp; C got a similar looking response and were also different from responses got from Payloads B &amp; D, thereby indicating the presence of this vulnerability.
<div class='fpa_check'><div class='fpa_check_title'>False Positive Check Assistance:</div>
To check if this was a valid case or a false positive you can first manually look at the responses received for Payloads A, B, C and D. Analyze these payloads and verify if indeed A &amp; C got similar responses and were different from B &amp; D. You can also change the payloads for A &amp; C by chaning the port number to some other invalid port and change payloads B &amp; D to some other valid port numbers and check of the four response show the same pattern as before.<br>If you discover that this issue was a false positive then please consider reporting this to <span class='icb'>lava<span class='inv'></span>@<span class='inv'></span>ironwasp<span class='inv'></span>.<span class='inv'></span>org</span>.
